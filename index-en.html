                    <br>
                    <p>The word Calisthenics is a combination of two Greek words; "Kalos" and "Sthénos". The word "Kalos" means
                         <strong>Beauty</strong> and the word "Sthénos" means <Strong>Power</Strong> , while the word calisthenics means
                          <strong>"Beautiful Power"</strong> .
                        
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Calisthenics is a type of training performed with minimal equipment or completely without equipment,
                         using one's own body weight and gravity.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Calisthenics' main goal is to have perfect control of their own body.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Calisthenics is based on some basic movements that we are all familiar with
                        such as <mark>Push-up</mark>, <mark>Pull-up</mark> and <mark>Handstand</mark>.
                        
                         
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="iarticles">
                    <h1 id="whycal">Why Calisthenics?</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There are many benefits of Calisthenics. But I'll list a few of the most important ones I've seen.
    
                    </p>
                    <br>
                   <ul>
                       <li><h3>You can train anywhere and without equipment</h3></li>
                       <br>
                       <p>If you do not have the opportunity to go to a gym and you want to train, you can use your body weight to train for 
                           many goals such as strength and endurance. Whether you're at home, in the park, or on vacation, all you have to do 
                           is find a free space and a place to hang, and you can get the perfect workout.
                       </p>
                       <br><br>
                       <li><h3>Exercises at different levels</h3></li>
                       <br>
                       <p>
                        I admit that it is not easy to increase or decrease weight in calisthenics like in the gym, but there 
                        is a wide variety of movements to suit all levels in calisthenics. Also, most moves have an easier and
                         harder progression. To give an example, if you can't do push-ups, you can try push-ups on your knees or you
                          can reduce the load on your muscles by placing your hands on a higher place.
                       </p>

                    <p>
                        Based on my own experience, I have prepared the things I wish I had done like this in the form of items as advice to you.
    
                    </p>

                       <br>
                       <li><h3>Don't Neglect the Warm Up</h3></li>
                       <br>
                       <p>
                        As a result of starting training and movements without warming up, injuries will occur in the short term or in the long term.
                         Even a 10-15 minute warm-up before your workout will be enough.
                       </p>
                       <br><br>
                       <li><h3>Practice Stretching and Mobility </h3></li>
                       <br>
                       <p>
                        Stretching and mobility exercises prevent injuries, contribute to the recovery process,
                         and are essential for some advanced movements.
                       </p> 
                       <br><br>
                       <li><h3>Choose the Movement and Movement Difficulty That Suits You</h3></li>
                       <br>
                       <p>
                        If we act with our ego and choose very difficult movements for ourselves, we will 
                        either cripple ourselves or hinder our development.
                         Even if we choose very easy movements, we cannot force ourselves.
                        
                       </p>
                       <br><br>
                       
                   </ul>

                       <li><h3>Don't Underestimate Basic Movements</h3></li>
                       <br>
                       <p>
                        First of all, master the basic moves. Working with calisthenics skills
                         before reaching a certain level in basic movements will slow down your development.
                       </p>
                       <br><br><br>
                       <li><h3>Don't get caught up in social media</h3></li>
                       <br>
                       <p>
                        Don't mind things like I got to this level in 30 days on social media. 
                        It is exaggerated to stand out across social media. Focus on your own development.
                       </p>
                       <br><br>
                       <li><h3>Get Started with Weight Calisthenics</h3></li>
                       <br>
                       <p>

                        After you reach a certain level, try to do the exercises by holding a weight by wearing a weight vest.
                         For example, if you do 50 push-ups, your progress will gradually decrease in that movement.
                        Because you won't be able to push the muscles enough anymore. Instead, you can put some weight
                         on your backpack and strap it to your back to more effectively strain the muscles.
                       </p>
