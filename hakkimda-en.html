                <p>
                    Hello there! I'm Eray Sarıkaya, founder of Calisthenics Warrior.  <br>
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I am from Ankara and I live in Ankara. I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Turkish Aeronautical Association.
                     I love my department and have a great interest in software. 
                </p>   
                <p>
                    As a result of my interest in sports, I dealt with various sports branches and brought my life into a whole with sports.
                     Although not professionally, I have been involved in sports such as swimming, gymnastics, martial arts, parkour, powerlifting and calisthenics.
                     I tried to improve myself and raise awareness by doing research, I am still working.

                    I think that ,you have to deal with just sport
                    you are involved in, which is a common thought will slow down or even limit our development. 
                    We can reach our goal more quickly by taking exercises suitable 
                     for ourselves and our goal from every sport branch and adding them to our own program. However, I think that people 
                     from all branches of sports should be aware of calisthenics and do the basic movements of calisthenics more accurately 
                     and properly. Because, first of all, a person should be able to control his own body.

                    The purpose of this site is to find and meet people like myself, to gain mutual awareness and even to inspire each other.
                     The slogan of the site says "Be The Best Version Of Yourself" and it means be your own self not anyone else but be the best version.
